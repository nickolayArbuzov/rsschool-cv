# My CV

### Introducing  
Hi! My name is Nikolay Arbuzov  

### Motivation ?  
For the last four years I have worked in retail companies, closely related to process management and having an active position to improve and optimize processes improved anything on my own, in my field and also made suggestions for improvement if the participation of a related department was required. But the overall result of the implementation did not suit me since there is bureaucracy, and a conservative attitude towards any new ideas and for myself, I did not find growth in that environment.  

I think, the desire to work in IT is associated with the easier the transformation of an idea into a product, a large community and the presence of charged people who can be like-minded people for me

### Skills  
In four years of working with data, I discovered the ability to analyze data, process analysis, business analysis, process automation, automation of human activities in the workplace, writing scripts with a high return on investment, writing technical tasks, understanding and solving problems of people in the workplace, data visualization, increasing the ergonomics and ecology of existing processes, creation of ergonomic and eco-friendly processes. This can all be attributed to Soft-skills.  

My Hard-skills are VBA, SQL, JS, Python, React, OOP, Unit-Testing, Debugging
