                <h2>What is my Motivation for transition to IT?</h2>
                <h4>
                    <p>For the last four years I have worked in retail companies, closely related to process management and 
                        having an active position to improve and optimize processes improved anything on my own, in my field 
                        and also made suggestions for improvement if the participation of a related department was required. 
                        But the overall result of the implementation did not suit me since there is bureaucracy, and a 
                        conservative attitude towards any new ideas and for myself, I did not find growth in that environment.</p>
                    <p>I think, the desire to work in IT is associated with the easier the transformation of an idea into 
                        a product, a large community and the presence of charged people who can be like-minded people for me</p>

                <h4>
                    <p>In four years of working with data, I discovered the ability to analyze data, process analysis, 
                        business analysis, process automation, automation of human activities in the workplace, writing 
                        scripts with a high return on investment, writing technical tasks, understanding and solving 
                        problems of people in the workplace, data visualization, increasing the ergonomics and ecology 
                        of existing processes, creation of ergonomic and eco-friendly processes. This can all be 
                        attributed to Soft-skills.</p>
                    <p>My Hard-skills are VBA, SQL, JS, Python, React, OOP, Unit-Testing, Debugging</p>

                <h2>Examples of code</h2>
                <h4>
                    <p>As a code example, I will give a self-written fragment of a possible strategy-game 
                        that draws a frame to select units. This fragment also uses a helper-function to 
                        find an element with a specific attribute. A click-eventlistener is added to the 
                        playing field, and after the click, an eventlistener for the mouse movement is added, 
                        and an additional semi-transparent div-element appears, redrawn when the moving-mouse 
                        is held down. The logic of the main function provides work in any direction of mouse 
                        movement, adaptively changing the bearing points of the drawn frame. When you release 
                        the click, the frame disappears. Unfortunately, it was not possible to implement the 
                        removal of the listener for the movement of the mouse, as it is proposed in popular 
                        sources, and while the removal of the listener is carried out by removing the playing 
                        field and replacing it with the same, new one.</p>
